### I am using the STM32F407VET6 microcontroller board.

- The base address for the peripherals is 0x40000000.
- There are two kinds of bus lines- APB (Advanced Peripheral Bus) and
  AHB (Advanced High performance Bus).
- AHB requires 1 clock cycles to access peripherals.
- APB requires 2 clock cycles to access peripherals.
- GPIO pins have atleast two registers - mode and data.
